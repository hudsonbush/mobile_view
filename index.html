            <p> Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!</P>
            <p> My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held. </p>

            <p>Chunky Doll or as he prefers to respond to, Chocks, is a 4-year-old ragdoll. His name was inspired by his breed and looks. As a kitten, he was even chunkier and blended right in with a fluffy white rug we had that he loved playing hide and seek in. He’s a very lazy but playful cat, only playful when he feels like it.</p>
            <p>He is a pretty but very difficult cat as he is white but hates showers and loves rolling around in the house collecting dust. To get him into a bath we often have to lure him in with fake human treats. And even then he jumps right out of the bath and runs around the whole bathroom making the floors wet. Nevertheless, he’s a very soft, cuddly, and loving cat.</p>

            <p> Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            </p> <p> Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.

            <p> Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch. Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with him. At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to let them know that he wants pets.
            </p> <p>  Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits with eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart and will only do tricks when you present him with snacks.

            <p> Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old, but he still likes to run around outside a lot. </p>
            <p>He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.
            </p>

            <p> Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.</P>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
